We are not just promising complete student anonymity; we guarantee it using our 3-step process of data submission:
>>>>>>> a4d456378c7572eb347a95e553419c3b61fb6f85

## Step 1 ##
You download our data submission tool, which takes in student data. This tool replaces sensitive student information (like names, addresses, etc.) with a student ID. If our tool misses some sensitive information, it allows you to select it manually with one click.

## Step 2 ##
The data we need, minus all the sensitive student information is converted into a CSV (something like an Excel file) which you can check and with which our analysis software works.

## Step 3 ##
You send us the CSV, confident about what information it contains.
The sensitive student information never leaves your school's system.

Once we have completed our analysis, our tool converts the student ID assigned in Step 1 back to the student name, so you can use what we found out. -->

## Data Processing Agreement

All data is covered under our [data-processing agreement](SSC-data-processing-agreement.docx), which guarantees privacy of all student information to the highest industry standards. All our data is stored locally and securely (encrypted). Only a small number of our employees has access to your data and all of them undergo extensive data sensitivity training.

## Optional: De-identification of Student Data
A number of our clients chooses to de-identify their student data before we analyse it. De-identified data has all personal information (names, adresses, dates of birth etc.) removed and replaced by a unique identifier number. Our analysis is just as effective, but students' personal information never leaves your system.

If you would like to de-identify your data, or have one of our employees come in to de-identify the data for you, feel free to [contact us](../contact/).
