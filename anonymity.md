We are not just promising complete student anonymity; we guarantee it using our 3-step process of data submission:

## Step 1 ##
You download our data submission tool, which takes in student data. This tool replaces sensitive student information (like names, addresses, etc.) with a student ID. If our tool misses some sensitive information, it allows you to select it manually with one click.

## Step 2 ##
The data we need, minus all the sensitive student information is converted into a CSV (something like an Excel file) which you can check and with which our analysis software works.

## Step 3 ##
You send us the CSV, confident about what information it contains.
The sensitive student information never leaves your school's system.

Once we have completed our analysis, our tool converts the student ID assigned in Step 1 back to the student name, so you can use what we found out.
