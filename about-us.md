## The Business

SSC Analytics is a young data analytics start-up based in Hammersmith, London. We founded the  company in early 2019 and have since been interviewing teachers and administrators to find out what features their schools would profit from the most.
## The Team
 
SSC Analytics was founded by the three Imperial College London students Jonas Scholz, Andreas Swerdlow, and Tiger Cross, with the plan to fundamentaly change the way schools are run, and the role that data plays in the day-to-day of secondary education. 

## The Plan

In the last 10 years most highly developed industries have restructured themselves to be driven by data. Entire sectors have emerged that are entirely driven by data; some of the most influential companies in the world (such as Google, Amazon or facebook) function only through the evaluation of user data. With most sectors completely restructuring themselves to become data-driven, we noticed that education is lagging far behind.

That is what we are going to change. By using all the pieces of information that are created over the course of a student's life and collecting data from across the nation centrally, we are able to enhance the way teachers understand their students and the way the schools are run, to ensure that all students learn in the best way for them individually.

## The present

We are now concluding the initial research phase and are starting to look for our first partners. Schools that join us early are guaranteed access until launch and one year beyond it. So what are you waiting for?
