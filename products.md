## Explore some of our most impactful features
We are contiunously working on new features, here's a small selection:
### Central Analytics Tool

Find out how students are performing and consider our predictions for the future. Every feature works both on a student by student level or for the class as a whole.

- Gain an overview of the development of students and see how they are predicted to develop. Are they going to meet their targets?
- Find out which parts of the course were understood well and which students should brush up on
- Get an early warning if a student is slipping off track so that any issues can be nipped in the bud.
- See how your students perform in other classes and find out how you and your colleagues complement each other.
- Find out which subjects are good A-level choices for which students, based on the performance of students across the country.

### Set Formation

Our set formation tool finds out which students perform well under similar circumstances - and proposes sets that fullfill these circumstances. [Read more](/set-formation/).

### Doppelgänger searches

For every student, our system can find a student in our database who is the most similar to the student in question. The benefit: our system searches for students across the nation, at any points in time.

From this so-called doppelgänger search, you can see how similar students have developed in the past - what subjects they chose for A-levels, whether they excelled and [much more](#).

### Educational Advisor:

We are developing a platform that takes in and analyses all the data for your institution and makes suggestions of various decisions that are the most likely to improve the performance of every student. The more data provided, the more helpful the assistant can be.

### Optimal Timetabler (TBA):

Soon, we will have created software that generates up to three optimal timetables for the institution given various constraints such as class sizes, subjects available, teacher avaiability etc.
