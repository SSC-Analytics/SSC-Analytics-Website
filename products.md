## Explore some of our most impactful features
We are contiunously working on new features, here's a small selection:
### Central Analytics Tool

Find out how students are performing and consider our predictions for the future. Every feature works both on a student by student level or for the class as a whole.

- Gain an overview of the development of students and see how they are predicted to develop. Are they going to meet their targets?
- Find out which parts of the course were understood well and which students should brush up on
- Get an early warning if a student is slipping off track so that any issues can be nipped in the bud.
- See how your students perform in other classes and find out how you and your colleagues complement each other.
- Find out which subjects are good A-level choices for which students, based on the performance of students across the country.

### Set Formation

Our set formation tool finds out which students perform well under similar circumstances - and proposes sets that fullfill these circumstances. [Read more](/set-formation/).

### Doppelgänger searches

For every student, our system can find a student in our database who is the most similar to the student in question. The benefit: our system searches for students across the nation, at any points in time.

From this so-called doppelgänger search, you can see how similar students have developed in the past - what subjects they chose for A-levels, whether they excelled and [much more](#).
