We've finished the website design and are currently planning the structure and design of the SSC platform. In parallel, we are reaching out to selected schools within London that are interested in joining our beta programme. 

By the end of 2019 we are aiming to have developed a beta version of our platform which incorporates our most fundamental analytics features while being easy to use. We will be attending education fairs and continuing our efforts to better understand the problems schools are facing today to improve our service on an ongoing basis.

As we are running this company in parallel to our full time studies, we are actively using the resources provided by (and experts researching in) Imperial College London to stay on the forefront of AI research and analytics approaches.

If you think we could benefit your school or college, or have any questions or feedback, get in touch via our contact form.
