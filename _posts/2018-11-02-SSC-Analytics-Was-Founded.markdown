This company was founded and created by three scholars of Imperial College London: Jonas Scholz, Andreas Swerdlow and Tiger Cross. Still currently in the education system, they intended to improve the overall learning experience for students in the UK using their skills and expertise.

With a great deal of interest in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, they wanted to make a contribution to society whilst using the most up to date technologies.
