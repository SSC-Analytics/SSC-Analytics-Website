Jonas, Andreas and Tiger worked to develop this website in Jekyll, so that they
could begin informing everyone about what they do and why they do it. They
intend to develop a separate platform for educational institutes to use in
improving their performance and student experience.

This website has a great contact form in case you'd like to get in touch though.
