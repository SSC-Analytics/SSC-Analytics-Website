## The What

We aim to create sets not by the marks students obtained, or at random, but instead in a way that lets every student succeed. 

## The How 

From the data you provide us we can find out which teachers a given student works well with. By grouping similar students together and having a teacher that they all work well with teach them, we ensure that every student thrives.

## The Why 

There are a number of ways in which your school can benefit from using our set-formation tool:

<ul>
<li>Forming sets takes time that teachers can make a much better use of</li>
<li>By forming sets based on the conditions under which students have previously thrived, we ensure that their learning experience is optimal</li>
<li>It is completely objective. There can not be any preferential treatment as the algorithm is completely universal and is exclusively quantitative.</li>
</ul>
